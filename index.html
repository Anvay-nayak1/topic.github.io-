        <h2>📚 Course Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the principles and techniques for designing efficient algorithms. The course focuses on the theoretical foundations and practical approaches for solving computational problems. Key topics include algorithmic design paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.

Students will explore the time and space complexity of algorithms, learning how to analyze and evaluate the performance of different algorithmic approaches. The course emphasizes problem-solving techniques to handle real-world challenges, providing students with the tools to optimize solutions and implement scalable, high-performance systems.

By the end of the course, students will not only be equipped with the ability to design algorithms for a wide range of problems but also gain proficiency in analyzing the efficiency and limitations of their solutions. This knowledge is critical for tackling complex computational problems in fields like software engineering, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>

        <h2>🚀 Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>The project focuses on designing a smart and efficient e-Bike Management System integrated into a city-wide transportation framework. The goal is to optimize the distribution, availability, and routing of electric bikes within the city, ensuring accessibility, convenience, and sustainability for users.</p>
